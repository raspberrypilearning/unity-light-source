Your scene already has a Directional Light, without it the scene would be dark.

You can add another Directional Light by clicking on **+** in the Hierarchy window and choosing **Light** > **Directional Light**.

You can change the position of the light, as well as adjust the colour and other settings.

Try creating interesting lighting effects to set the mood for your scene.
