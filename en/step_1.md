Your scene already has a Directional Light, without it the scene would be dark. 

You can add another Directional Light by clicking on '+' in the Hierarchy and choosing 'Light' -> 'Directional Light'. 

You can change the position of the light, adjust the colour and other settings. 

Try creating interesting lighting effects to set the mood for your scene.
